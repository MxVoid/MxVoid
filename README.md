## Main Focus
- Malware development & research (educational purposes only)
- Reverse engineering
- Exploit development
- Concepts and PoCs for different types of malware
- Other random hobby projects

Everything here is strictly for **learning and research**. I do not support or encourage malicious use.

Still learning every day.
